#ARM assembly practice
##a detour on my raspi3

* The goal is just to implement itoA (integer to C-style null terminated string)
* Rules
	* I can compile sub-routines for reference (such as a faster way to perform modulo) but I cannot just compile atoi
	* The C program handles printing
	* Must follow ARM assembly best practices, whatever those are... will be updated RIP I just re-learned the x86 calling conventions and here we are
	* haha
	* RIP... or should I say... PC
